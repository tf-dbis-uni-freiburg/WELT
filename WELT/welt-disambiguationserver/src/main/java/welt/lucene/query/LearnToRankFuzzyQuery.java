/**
 * Implements the fuzzy search query. The similarity measurement is based on the
 * Damerau-Levenshtein (optimal string alignment) algorithm, though you can
 * explicitly choose classic Levenshtein by passing <code>false</code> to the
 * <code>transpositions</code> parameter.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This query uses {@link MultiTermQuery.TopTermsScoringBooleanQueryRewrite} as
 * default. So terms will be collected and scored according to their edit
 * distance. Only the top terms are used for building the {@link BooleanQuery}.
 * It is not recommended to change the rewrite mode for fuzzy queries.
 * 
 * <p>
 * At most, this query will match terms up to
 * {@value org.apache.lucene.util.automaton.LevenshteinAutomata#MAXIMUM_SUPPORTED_DISTANCE} edits.
