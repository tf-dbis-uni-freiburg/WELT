# WELT - Wikidata Entity Linking Tool

Wikidata Entity Linking Tool was a project that was developed during my Master Thesis. It utilizes Wikidata as a knowledge base and DoSeR as a framework to build an Entity Linking system for easy and precise text annotation. It uses RDF2Vec for a Word2Vec model and has a generic mention detection step.
