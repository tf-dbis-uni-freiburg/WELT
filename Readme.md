# WELT - Wikidata Entity Linking Tool

Wikidata Entity Linking Tool was a project that was developed during my Master Thesis. It utilizes Wikidata as a knowledge base and DoSeR as a framework to build an Entity Linking system for easy and precise text annotation. It uses RDF2Vec for a Word2Vec model and has a generic mention detection step.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1. Clone the repository to a desired directory.

```
git clone [https://github.com/tf-dbis-uni-freiburg/WELT/](https://github.com/tf-dbis-uni-freiburg/WELT/)
```

2. Install Eclipse or a similar enviornment.
3. Make sure that Maven is set up.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running.

1. Import the project in to Eclipse.
2. Connect the WELT project with the Index of Surface Forms (Lucene Index) in the language that you need.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example [https://github.com/tf-dbis-uni-freiburg/WELT/](https://github.com/tf-dbis-uni-freiburg/WELT/)
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
